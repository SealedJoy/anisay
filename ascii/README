Add your own ascii character by creating a folder with a series of frames (numerically named text based files)

The ascii files should contain the same consitent amount of lines and colums across each frame of the animation, you may require padding lines with extra spaces if needed.

You can use any amount of frames but they must use the numbered extensions.
for example:
new_cow/new_cow.1
new_cow/new_cow.2
etc

You can then run with the -a flag and enter the name of corrisponding folder
